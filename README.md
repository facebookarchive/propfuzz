# propfuzz: structured fuzzing through property-based testing, in Rust

This repository contains the source code for:

* [`propfuzz`](propfuzz): a Rust library for writing property-based tests with
  [proptest](https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest/) which can then be used as structured fuzz targets for mutation-based
  fuzzers 
* [`propfuzz-derive`](propfuzz-derive): procedural macros to make writing `propfuzz` tests easy 

The code in this repository is in a **pre-release** state and is under active development.
